# Description

Once we know R at a basic level, the best way to sharpen our R skills is by working on a data analysis problem head-on. 
In this course, we takes a use-case-based approach by tackling the New York City taxi data using R. There are ample lab exercises to reinforce concepts and learn new ones.

We do not shy away from using third-party packages when doing simplifies our work: and in particular GIS packages, ggplot2 for plotting, and dplyr for data processing. However, only dplyr is relevant to the course and explored in-depth. Data visualization and GIS packages are out of scope and not covered in-depth, 
although a basic explanation is provided and all the code will be provided for users who want to delve more in-depth on their own time.

While we do not cover Microsoft R Server (MRS) during this course, a secondary goal of the course is to prepare users for MRS and its set of tools and capabilities for scalable big data-processing and analytics. 
So this course can also be viewed as a prerequisite for taking learning to use MRS.

After completing this course, participants will be able to use R to perform a thorough data analysis task that starts with ingesting a raw flat file and performing exploratory data analysis, with lots of summaries and visualizations to boot. The user will gain an appreciation for packages such as dplyr in helping us set up robust and easy-to-modify data pipelines, ggplot2 and its straightforward notation, and will learn to think better like an R programmer and write more efficient and straight-forward R code.

# Details

## Intended Audience:

Familiarity with R is needed. This course is not a beginner-level R course. Users are assumed to know enough R to be familiar with basic data types (vectors, lists, data.frames) and programming constructs (loops, functions, and apply family of functions). There are many beginner-level R tutorials online including in places like edX.org or just youtube. Please come up to speed on R basics and familiarize yourself with an R IDE such as RStudio or Visual Studio with R Tools before coming to class.

## Course Level

Intermediate

## Prerequisites

- Know your R data types: vector, array, list, and data.frame. Know what sets each apart, what they have in common, and what advantages they each offer, and how to subset each object.
- Know how to write basic R functions.
- Be comfortable using an R IDE (such as Visual Studio with RTVS or RStudio).
- Have a basic understanding of common data analysis tasks.

## Agenda

We will follow the following workflow during the course.
- Setting up the environment
- Loading data into R
- Inspecting the data: We run sanity checks on the data and get a feel for the data
- Cleaning the data: We deal with column types, especially with the factor columns
- Being more efficient: We learn how pre-processing can lead to more efficiency
- Creating new features: Starting with the raw data, we ask how we can make it a more useful data to the analysis by adding relevant features
- Data summary and visualization: We explore various ways we can summarize the data using both base R and dplyr. We use ggplot2 to visualize resultse
